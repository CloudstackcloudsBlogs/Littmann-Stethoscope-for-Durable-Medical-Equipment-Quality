                <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">Product Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The Littmann Electronic Stethoscope Model 3200 is built for superior sound quality, offering healthcare professionals the ability to hear subtle bodily sounds with remarkable clarity. This stethoscope utilizes proprietary Ambient Noise Reduction (ANR) technology, which can cancel out up to 85% of ambient background noise, making it ideal for use in noisy environments such as hospitals and emergency rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This model also features up to 24X sound amplification, providing crystal-clear auscultation to help you detect even the faintest heart murmurs or lung abnormalities. The Littmann Electronic Stethoscope stores up to 12 thirty-second tracks onboard so that you can save important sounds for future reference. Each track can also be annotated with a 10-second comment, allowing you to document your findings for later review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Designed for comfort and ease of use, this stethoscope includes snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips that provide a secure fit and reduce ambient noise. The state-of-the-art sound sensor creates a lifelike audio experience that’s comparable to high-end cardiology stethoscopes, and the frictional noise reduction technology minimizes handling noises to ensure nothing gets in the way of your assessment.
                </p>
